# Derek's Lesson Plan

Objective: To get up to junior ruby developer level and job ready by May 2018
__Note: If you find any thing difficult or run into problems, ask questions. Ask Google, ask StackOverflow, ask me. Communication is more than important when developing/engineering__

## Lesson Plan

### 1hr Weekly Sessions

#### 1 - Objects, Classes, Methods
You'll learn what is meant by "everything is an object" in the Ruby programming language, how classes relate to objects and methods.
Homework:
  - Write 2 blog posts, one has to be about what something new you've learnt.
  - Draw a diagram showing the relationship between Object, classes and methods. This can be as literal or abstract as you like, as long as you can explain what's happening.
  - Update your jekyll blog so that the front page looks identical to your website.
  
#### 2 - Collections
We'll be looking at Ruby's collection objects; arrays and hashes, and how to use and iterate over them.
Homework:
  - Write one blog post on something you've learnt
  - Write a program that iterates through a hash and stores the values of the hash in an array.
  - Update your jekyll blog so that you have a blog index page, put a link for this page on the front page so that visitors can visit your blog page.
  
#### 3 - Control Structures
This week you'll be learning about the difference between `if`, `until`, `while` and `unless` and when to use them.
Homework:
- One blog post
- Add two of the four control sturctures you've learnt to your program from last week

#### 4 - Symbols & Dynamic Typing
A two in one, we'll cover what a symbol is and how it differs from a string, as well as looking at how to effectively use dynamic typing in our ruby programs - and what that means.
- Two blog posts, one should explain what dynamic typing is.

### 4hr Monthly Sessions
These sessions will not have homework.

#### 1 - What is Object Oriented Programming?
This will also space to revisit where we are with coding & fill in knowledge gaps in what you've already learnt and answer questions/bug-fix. We will also look into what is meant by Object Oriented programming and you'll write a few classes that work together in a program.
